# uilibrary

currently this is a work in progress, and it was all programmed without a gui-to-script plugin plus its my first ui lib so pleez go easy on me :c

modulescript found in /Main.lua

change the colour scheme and keybinds by going to ``mainModule.colourscheme`` and ``mainModule.keyboardSettings`` in the main module

if you are requiring this module from the server, you are required to pass in a ``player`` argument that has a valid PlayerGui. if this is done in the client, it is handled for you.

**syn eggsploit GUI protect is enabled**
